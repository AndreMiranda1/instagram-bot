# instagram-bot
Kinda bot implementation using selenium library, it is supossed to mimic a human behaviour.
It does like, follow and unfollow. You can set it to a random behaviour or focus on the type of actions you want.

In this bot implementation I used:
- Selenium library to automate the action of using the browser;
- PostgreSQL to record the actions, tracking and so on;
- Webcrawling and scrapping to find specefic elements in the HTML and navigate between pages.
